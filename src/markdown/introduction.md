<h1>Hey</h1>
I'm Ray. I love design and strive for flawless execution.

I've been passionate about web design since I was 12 years old. Wanting to be an illustrator, I opted for a degree in graphic design instead. Web development allows me to marry my love for art with my desire for organization. The results are thoughtful compositions with full functionality.


I'm a *triple-threat* with self-taught experience in front-end web development, graphic design, and motion graphics.
